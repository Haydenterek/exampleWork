## Assignment from algorithms and data structures 2
This assignment comes directly from Dr. John Ramirez at the University of Pittsburgh. The purpose of this assignment was to utilize graph algorithms covered in class and create the shortest route between cities using an airline. The README located in the CS1501 folder gives more insight into the assignment itself. The algorithm used in this instance was Dijkstra's shortest path.
