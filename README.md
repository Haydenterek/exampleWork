## Assignment from algorithms and data structures 2
This assignment comes directly from Dr. John Ramirez at the University of Pittsburgh. The purpose of this assignment was to utilize graph algorithms covered in class and create the shortest route between cities using an airline. The README located in the CS1501 folder gives more insight into the assignment itself. The algorithm used in this instance was Dijkstra's shortest path.

## Assignment from database management systems
This assignment is derived from professor Panos Chrysanthis at the University of Pittsburgh. This assignment was a group project that required us to build a database system from the ground up. Utilizing both triggers and procedures, as well as, Java based tests to ensure our system was implemented correctly. This project took place in different stages starting with the database design, physical table creation, to the implementation of the database. The README located in the ArborDB folder can give more insight into the assignment itself.
